👋 Hi, everyone!

Welcome to the open-source code for the NeurIPS 2025 paper, "[Beyond the 80/20 Rule: High-Entropy Minority Tokens Drive Effective Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01939)." Thank you for your interest!

## Installation

Our code is based on [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) (commit id `6cf90ceb079bdc0721b51c23e0107410651ccd82`). 

We recommend using [this Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/hiyouga/verl/ngc-th2.7.1-cu12.6-vllm0.10.0/images/sha256-cfc8c1ce3ea52dee0444f3e58e900d0b1d3b6b315deaf5f58c44b5fbb52fa989), with the following command:

```bash
docker pull hiyouga/verl:ngc-th2.7.1-cu12.6-vllm0.10.0
```

Alternatively, you can refer to [the verl documentation](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html) for instructions on installing the environment. We recommend aligning the installed environment with the Docker image mentioned above.

## Dataset Preparation

For the training dataset, we recommend using the [math dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM360/guru-RL-92k/resolve/main/train/math__combined_54.4k.parquet) from the [Reasoning360 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14965), as it is more comprehensive than the [DAPO-Math-17k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k) dataset used in our paper.

For the test dataset, we followed the original setup of [DAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476).

To align the format of the training dataset with the test dataset, we provide [recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/transfer_dataset.py](recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/transfer_dataset.py) to convert the training dataset file.

In summary, you can use the script [recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/prepare_train_test_datasets.sh](recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/prepare_train_test_datasets.sh) to prepare the training and test datasets.

## Model Preparation

For the base model, we recommend using [Qwen3-14B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B-Base). According to our paper, RLVR with the top 20% of high-entropy tokens results in a significant performance improvement when scaling the model to 14B or larger. You can download the [Qwen3-14B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B-Base) model to the path `${VERL_HOME}/models/Qwen3-14B-Base/` .

> [!NOTE]
>
> We currently only support the FSDP backend for RLVR with high-entropy tokens. The Megatron backend is not yet supported or verified.

## How to Run

For the DAPO baseline on [Qwen3-14B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B-Base), please refer to the script [recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/run_dapo_qwen3_14b.sh](recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/run_dapo_qwen3_14b.sh).

For our proposed method, i.e. DAPO with the top 20% high-entropy tokens, on [Qwen3-14B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B-Base), please refer to the script [recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/run_only_top20_high_entropy_tokens_dapo_qwen3_14b.sh](recipe/rlvr_with_high_entropy_tokens_only/run_only_top20_high_entropy_tokens_dapo_qwen3_14b.sh).
